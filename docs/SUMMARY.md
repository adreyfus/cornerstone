# Cornerstone

> Cornerstone is an open source project with a goal to deliver a complete web based medical imaging platform.

This documentation focuses on Cornerstone Core, which is a lightweight JavaScript library for displaying medical images in modern web browsers that support the HTML5 canvas element. Cornerstone Core is not meant to be a complete application itself, but rather a component that can be used as part of larger, more complex applications.

While this documentation grows, the [old GitHub wiki](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone/wiki) may be a better source.

**[Release Notes](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone/releases)**
